This exercise created 2D and 3D correspondence analysis using plotly in R. 

The xlsx file "experiment_summary_9.26.2018" contained the raw data that we wanted to visualize in either 2D or 3D. The data was about customer journey on Bloomberg.com (using a similar sql script attached here). Essentially, if we knew people were currently reading Topic A and we could find all the topics and their likelihood of being read by the same group of people in the near future (such as 14-day forward, 15-to-21 day forward, 22-to-28 day forward, 29-to-35 day forward, etc.), what's the best way of visualizing these topics (bundling topics and timeline together)? Likewise, instead of "forward", we could do "backward". For example, we knew what people were reading this week, and we could work backward and find all topics and their associated likelihood of being read by the same people in the past 90-day period.

This project served as a proof-of-concept for building a future data visualization tool within Bloomberg AiQ (Artificial Intelligence Query). We were interested in presenting/clustering topics by timeline. We wanted to see whether it could be visually easier or beneficial for sales & marketing team to understand this "customer journey" concept through these 2D or 3D plots - these plots grouped timeline and topics together!
